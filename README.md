# React App
### This is my first React App. It contains two basics apps.
#### 1. A to-do App
#### 2. An App to fetch weather data from 150 cities, and a city name filter

## Technologies used
1. ReactJS
2. SweetAlert
3. TailwindCSS
4. Axios

# Setting up

1. You **MUST** have nodejs, npm & yarn installed.
2. Create an account at _https://developer.accuweather.com/_ so you can get an API KEY (This is needed to be able to use the Weather App)
3. Inside the project folder, at the root path, create a _.env_ file
4. Edit that file and add the following line
> REACT_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY={YOUR_API_KEY}
5. Of course, don't put the curly braces.
6. Run  `yarn start` or `npm install`
7. If you have an error that says _This version of npm is compatible with lockfileVersion@1, but npm-shrinkwrap.json was generated for lockfileVersion@0. I'll try to do my best with it!_, delete node_modules folder and package-lock.json
8. Run `npm i`
9. Run `yarn start`
